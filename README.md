# Riakpb-node

Self-contained implementation of a client for a Riak database using Protocol Buffers.
This is a binary protocol with persistent connection, so it should be faster than independent HTTP requests.

Sometimes it's nice to have a library with no dependencies.

Work in progress and not heavily tested, there may be broken functionality, utf8 shenanigans or unknown bugs.
